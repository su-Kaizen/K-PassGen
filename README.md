K-PassGen is a password generator that can create passwords with random chars and words (a 2000 words list). This is my first proyect using JavaFX so probably the code is a little bit crap.

The random chars mode is very simple, just select with the slide bar the lenght of your password and you are ready to go.

The random words mode is a bit more advanced; You cand adjust the generation as you like with these diferent options: 
- Number of words
- Numbers at the ending of the password
- Delimiter between words
- Capitalize the first letter
